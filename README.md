Visual Studio 2017 | [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/swutsp1bjcc56q64/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ddiakopoulos/hand-tracking-samples/branch/master)

Forked from [IntelRealSense/hand_tracking_samples](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/hand_tracking_samples) 

Modified the camera wrapper in dcam.h and some parts in the main codes to use librealsense2 so that realtime-hand-tracker can be used with Intel® RealSense™ D400 Series Camera

Note: .../third_party/librealsense2/librealsense.vc15/Release-x64/realsense2.lib was built on vs2017 using Release x64
